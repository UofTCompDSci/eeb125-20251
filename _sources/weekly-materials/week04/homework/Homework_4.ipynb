    "\n",
    "We will be using data from <https://www.genderscilab.org/gender-and-sex-in-covid19> for the week of 11/1/2021, which is available in `covid_sex.csv`. To inform your exploration, please read the article \"Whatâ€™s Really Behind the Gender Gap in Covid-19 Deaths?\", printed in the New York Times, available in `nytimes_covid_sex.pdf` (go to File -> Open... to open this PDF). We will be exploring this dataset to interpret whether 1) we can observe sex-based differences in the risk of death among those infected with COVID and 2) whether we can identify any sociopolitical, as opposed to biological, explanations for any observed differences."
