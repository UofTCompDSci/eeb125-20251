    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will ask a question about how mammalian reproductive strategies relate to their conservation risk. We will combine information from two different datasets to investigate this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data science question for the week:\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we will be combining data on mammalian ecology to compute a metric that we will call \"maximum lifetime fecundity\". This value estimates a species' __reproductive potential__. That is, *how prodigious is each species at producing new offspring*? \n",
    "\n",
    "As biologists, we may have an intuition that species that are more capable at reproducing quickly maybe more resilient to extinction as the environment changes. We will see how this metric relates to extinction risk, as calclated from IUCN data to ask a targeted question about mammalian conservation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**_Is there a difference in extinction risk between species with higher reproductive potential (greater maximum lifetime fecundity) vs. species with lower reproductive potential smaller maximum lifetime fecundity)?_**"

    "### Problem 1b. Calculate our lifetime fecundity metric\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now estimate a new measurement that we will call `max_lifetime_fecundity`. Use the following formula to calculate this metric:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{longevity - maturity}{interbirth} * litter\\_size $$\n",

    "This will be computed using the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `maturity_d`: How long it takes for the average individual to grow to sexual maturity. This is the earliest age at which an individual can reproduce. This is measured in *days* as the interval between birth and the time when the individual first reproduces.\n",
    " \n",
    "- `longevity_m`: The maximum observed lifespan of an individual within each species, expressed in *months*.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `interbirth_d`: How long adult females wait, on average, between giving birth and becoming pregnant again, expressed in *days*.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `litter_size_ind`: How many babies females within each species have at one time, on average. The units are individuals, or number of offspring.\n",

    "\n",
    "Create an empty dictionary and assign it to a variable called `max_fecund`.\n",

    "Loop over the lines of data and split up the columns using a comma delimiter and apply the above formula to the data across each column. Keep in mind that you will need to mind missing data, which is expressed in this datafile as an empty string, `\"\"`. Since you will not be able to calculate the metric unless all four measurements are present, use exception handling to skip over any line that is missing any one or more of these.\n",

    "\n",
    "The three measurements relating to time (`'maturity_d'`, `'longevity_m'`, and `'interbirth_d'`) are expressed in two different units. As you loop over the lines and calculate this metric from the values in each column, convert each of these columns so that they are expressed in years. \n"
