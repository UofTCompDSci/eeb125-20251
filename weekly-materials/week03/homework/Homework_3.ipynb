We will study this by using a dataset of forearm lengths and total body length (expressed as head-body length), both measured in millimeters, measured at the level of individual species.\n",

For example, the scientific name for humans is \"Homo sapiens\". So our genus is \"Homo\", and species is \"sapiens\". Often, species within the same genus are quite similar. To make our numbers a bit easier to parse through, let's find the maximum relative forearm length found in each genus. You will want to pick the first word from each species name, and then associate it with a list containing the measurements for each genus\n",
