    "We will create a new metric using the PanTHERIA data that estimates: how many offspring do individuals within each species produce throughout their lifetime, on average? We call this \"lifetime fecundity\". We will be looking to see whether there is a relationship between average lifetime fecundity and a species' risk of going extinct.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Start a data story in a notebook exploring the question: is the number of offspring birthed by a lineage related to its risk of extinction?\n",
    "* Write and use advanced Boolean expressions to filter specific observations in our dataset. (Specifically, you're encourage to practice using logical operators such as `!=`, `<=`, `>=`, `>`, `<`.)\n",
    "* Join two related datasets to create a larger, more comprehensive dataset.\n",
