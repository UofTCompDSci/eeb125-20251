    "# EEB125H1 Data Science Conference\n",
    "\n",
    "The final project for this course will use data science methods including programming and statistical analysis of data on conservation risk and organismal biology.  You will present your findings in the style of an oral presentation at an academic Data Science Conference (DSC).  You and your team will give a short oral presentation of your findings, and be prepared to answer questions about your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) that produced the slides for the presentation, to be submitted by **April 4, 23:59 (11:59 P.M. - Toronto time)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A 10 minute pre-recorded **video presentation** of your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please see submission instructions below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission Information\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forming a Group \n",
    "\n",
    "First, select one student in the group to create the group. That student should: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Login to [MarkUs](https://markus.teach.cs.toronto.edu/markus/main/login_remote_auth).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Go to *Proj_02: Course Project Phase 2 (Final Submission)*, and the `Submissions` tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Click on `Create Group`. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Then after your group is created, click on Invite student(s). \n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Enter the **UTORids** of each other group member (you'll need to ask them for this information). \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, every *other* student should: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Login to [MarkUs](https://markus.teach.cs.toronto.edu/markus/main/login_remote_auth).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Go to *Proj_02: Course Project Phase 2 (Final Submission)*, and the `Submissions` tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Look for the group invitation and click on `Join Group`. **Warning**: this must be done before the due date!! \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submitting Files \n",
    "\n",
    "Submitting your group's files works the same way as other assignments, except *only one person from the group needs to submit the files*. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, upload your video recording to the University of Toronto MyMedia platform, <https://mymedia.library.utoronto.ca>. Again, only one student in the group needs to do this.\n",
    "2. After uploading the video, obtain the \"Permanent Link\" to the video but clicking on the \"Share\" button.\n",
    "    This link should look something like\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    https://play.library.utoronto.ca/watch/1234567abcdefg...\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Add this URL to the top of your group's Jupyter notebook file, and clearly label it as the link to your presentation recording.\n",
    "4. Then, submit your group's Jupyter notebook file to MarkUs under *Proj_02: Course Project Phase 2 (Final Submission)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Your TA will need to be able to see your full notebook file and access the video URL, so please double-check both of them before making your final submission!**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Slides\n",
    "\n",
    "- You should produce your slides using the Jupyter notebook Slideshow Extension RISE which is available on the [UofT Jupyterhub](https://jupyter.utoronto.ca). The template of a Jupyter notebook document to produce the slides for your presentation is [here](eeb125_project_slides.ipynb).  You will be allowed to present ten content slides (i.e., does not include slides to break up sections described below).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your presentation slides should include reproducible Python output (i.e., graphs, tables should be produced by Python code not hard-coded or inserted as an image), but not Python code unless it's directly related to one of the sections below.  See the [template](eeb125_project_slides.ipynb) for an example of how to write code chunks to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your title slide must include the names of your team members, your tutorial section (e.g., TUTXXXX), and your group number as assigned by your TA.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your slides should include the following sections: \n",
    "\n",
    "   + Introduction \n",
    "   + Data \n",
    "   + Methods \n",
    "   + Results \n",
    "   + Conclusion  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A few guidelines for an effective presentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your slides should be clear, concise, and easy to read quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not use small fonts as it will need to be read without zooming in.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Figures/plots/visuals often display information more efficiently than text. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Numbered or bulleted lists convey points in slides more effectively than blocks of text. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Video Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Your group will be asked to record a 10-minute video presentation summarizing your work. This time limit is firm and the grader will not watch beyond the 10-minute mark of any videos. Do not increase the video speed in order to squeeze it into the alotted time. Speech and pacing of the video should be digestible for the viewer/grader. Each team member must speak during this presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Teamwork\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will work in a group comprised of either 3 or 4 students in the same tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "- All team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of the project.  All team members must present part of the oral video presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your group may not work with members of another group.  You may not discuss the project with anyone except for your team, professors, and the course TAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are concerned about any issues with your team, contact a member of the teaching team as soon as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Students will be evaluated as a team.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Grade component                  |  Value \n",
    "---------------------------------|--------\n",
    "Content of slides                |  50%\n",
    "Reproducibility of slide content |  10%\n",
    "Oral Video Presentation                |  40%\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reproducibility of Slides\n",
    "\n",
    "- The rubric for the content of the slides evaluation is below. "
