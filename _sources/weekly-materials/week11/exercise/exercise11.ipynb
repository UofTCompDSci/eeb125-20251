    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For these exercises, we will investigate the predominance of coral presence in relation to temperature. We will analyze data coming from six sites within a coral reef in French Polynesia. Scientists collected data there from 2005 to 2022. The sampling design involves swimming away from the shore over the corals, and every 10 meters take a photo of the bottom surface, using a square of a defined size. This kind of data collection uses something called a \"quadrat sampling design along several linear transects increasing in depth\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Once in the lab, the biodiversity is estimated in terms of surface cover. How much area of the square is occupied by each species or abiotic component (E.g. corals, algae, sand). \n",
    "Since the linear transect runs from towards the inner ocean, as the scientists swimm off-shore, depth increases and temperature decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore how the surface cover changes as these two conditions change.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Question\n",
    "\n",
    "_Questions: At which temperature do we find a greater percentage cover of corals? Do corals prefer warmer temperatures than the mean temperature across sites or colder temperatures?_\n"
